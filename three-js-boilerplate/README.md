# Three.js boilerplate
This is a simple three.js boilerplate for new projects, feel free to contribute!

What is npm?

npm makes it easy for JavaScript developers to share, update and reuse code.

npm is installed with Node.js.

Once inside the directory of this repo, run 'npm install' in your terminal, this will install the following dependencies
(you can see them inside the package.json file):

Project Dependencies:
express: 4.16.2 : npm install express |
js-shortid: 0.1.1 : npm install js-shortid |
node-osc: 2.1.0 : npm install node-osc |
socket.io: 2.0.4 : npm install socket.io 

For remote access on your phone:
https://ngrok.com
Save to documents or somewhere where you have easy access.

ngrok will be listening on port 8000, so open another terminal tab and run ngrok by copying
the path + port:
e.g. /Users/default/Documents/ngrok http 8000

Once everything is ready run 'node index.js'

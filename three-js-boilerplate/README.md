What is npm?

npm makes it easy for JavaScript developers to share, update and reuse code.

npm is installed with Node.js.

Once inside the directory of this repo, run 'npm install' in your terminal, this will install the following dependencies
(you can see them inside the package.json file):

Project Dependencies:
"express": "^4.16.2" : npm install express
"js-shortid": "^0.1.1" : npm install js-shortid
"node-osc": "^2.1.0", : npm install node-osc
"socket.io": "^2.0.4", : npm install socket.io

Once everything is ready run 'node index.js'
